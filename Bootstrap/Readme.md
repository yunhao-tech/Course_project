# Brief summary of TD

- TD1: use **Jackknife** to estimate the asymptotic variance (Ex.1) and bias (Ex.2) of estimators

- TD2: use the **bootstrap** to estimate the bias (Ex.2) and variance (Ex.1, possibly to use Boostrap of Boostrap) of an estimator/statistic

- TD3: apply the theory for the bootstrap (Ex.1); see the limitations of the bootstrap (Ex.2); a weighted bootstrap scheme (Ex.3).
