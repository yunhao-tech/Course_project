        "We want to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to do image super-resolution.\n",

        "\n",
        "The super-resolution problem can be summarised as follows. We have an image as an input, which is defined over a grid $\\{0,1,\\dots, m-1\\} \\times \\{0,1,\\dots, n-1\\}$. We define a factor $\\delta$, by which we upsample the image. The output of the super-resolution is an image defined on the grid $\\{0,\\frac{1}{\\delta},\\dots, m-1\\} \\times \\{0,\\frac{1}{\\delta},\\dots, n-1\\}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Model\n",
        "\n",
        "In this part of the TP, you have complete freedom to create any model you want, as long as the input is an image, and the output is also an image of size $\\delta m \\times \\delta n$. You will have to choose the architecture and loss which seems reasonable to you.\n",
        "\n",
        "To help you, here is a function to upsample images in neural networks :\n",

        "## Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "We will be using the mnist dataset for this part. This is to ensure that you can obtain good results. The input data should be the subsampled version of the mnist images, subsampled by taking one out of every $\\delta$ pixels. The output data should be the normal-resolution mnist images.\n",

        "__IMPORTANT NOTES:__\n",
        "- Think carefully about what the training data and labels are in this case, and create them accordingly\n",
        "- We will use ```n_max=5000``` to limit the number of datapoints (as in part 1) to go faster\n",
        "- We set $\\delta$ to 2 in this TP, because it is not too difficult to create a network that works with this factor. If you change it, it might be more difficult to create a satisfactory network.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Your task:\n",
        "You have to load the mnist data (see the first part of the TP), create the model, train it, and evaluate and display the results.\n",
